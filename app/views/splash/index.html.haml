        %h1 About this site
        %p
          This site was built to scratch one particular itch:
          %br
          it was too hard to keep track of where bills are in the legislative process.
        %p
          At the federal level, <a href="https://congress.gov/">Congress.gov</a> allows you to
          receive alerts when bills change status.
          %br
          The same feature ought to exist for all 50 states.

        %p
          That's what this site tries to accomplish:
          %br
          single-click follows of bills you are interested in.
        %p
          We don't track you.
          %br
          We don't care what you're following or what you're searching for.
          %br
          We don't sell your email or contact information to anyone.
          %br
          We just want to make it
          easy to keep up-to-date with activity in your state legislature.
